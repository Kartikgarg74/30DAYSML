Day 18: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) — Creating New Data 🌟
Welcome to the Day 18 repository of the 30 Days of Deep Learning series! 🎉 This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and resources for understanding and implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

📘 About This Notebook
In this notebook, we explore:

Introduction to GANs:

What GANs are and how they work.
The interplay between the Generator and the Discriminator.
Mathematical Formulation:

The optimization objective of GANs.
Loss functions used for training both networks.
Implementation:

Building a simple GAN to generate images from the MNIST dataset.
Step-by-step explanation of the code.
Visualization:

Plotting generated images during training.
Graphs for Generator and Discriminator losses.
Applications and Limitations:

Real-world use cases of GANs.
Challenges in training GANs.
