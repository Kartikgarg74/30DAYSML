# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Welcome to the **Day 16** repository of our 30-Day Machine Learning series! In this repository, you'll find all the resources, code snippets, and materials needed to understand and implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification and related tasks.

---

## 📋 **Overview**
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of deep learning model designed to process and analyze grid-like data, such as images. In this session, we cover:

1. **What is a CNN?**
   - Structure and components: Convolutional layers, Pooling layers, Fully connected layers
2. **How CNNs Work:**
   - Convolution operations, feature extraction, and the role of pooling
3. **Building a CNN Model:**
   - Step-by-step implementation using TensorFlow/Keras on the CIFAR-10 dataset
4. **Hyperparameters:**
   - Key parameters like filters, kernel size, pooling size, and learning rate
5. **Visualizing Feature Maps:**
   - Understanding what the CNN learns during training
