# Day 14: Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning  

This repository contains all the code examples, visualizations, and resources for **Day 14** of the **30-Day Machine Learning Learning Path**, focusing on **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques. These techniques are crucial for simplifying high-dimensional data, improving computational efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability of datasets.

## **Contents**  

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   - Explanation of PCA: A linear technique for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.  
   - Code implementation with Scikit-learn and visualization using the Iris dataset.  
   - Key insights about explained variance and principal components.  

2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**  
   - Overview of t-SNE: A nonlinear technique for visualizing complex, high-dimensional data.  
   - Implementation with hyperparameter tuning (`perplexity`, `learning_rate`, `max_iter`).  
   - Visualizing clusters and understanding local vs. global structure.  

3. **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**  
   - Introduction to UMAP: Faster and scalable dimensionality reduction.  
   - Implementation with the Iris dataset and parameter explanations (`n_neighbors`, `min_dist`).  
   - Comparison with t-SNE and PCA for preserving structure.  

4. **Comparisons and Key Takeaways**  
   - Side-by-side comparison of PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.  
   - Best use cases for each technique.

## **Code Examples**  

The repository includes three separate scripts for each dimensionality reduction technique:  

1. **`pca_example.py`**  
   - Contains PCA implementation with visualization and variance explanation percentages.  

2. **`tsne_example.py`**  
   - Includes t-SNE with tuned hyperparameters for optimal cluster visualization.  

3. **`umap_example.py`**  
   - UMAP implementation with better handling of local and global data structure.

## **How to Run the Scripts**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-30-days.git  
   cd machine-learning-30-days/dimensionality-reduction  
   ```  

2. Run any script using Python:  
   ```bash  
   python pca_example.py  
   python tsne_example.py  
   python umap_example.py  
   ```  

3. Visualizations will be displayed directly as scatter plots.
