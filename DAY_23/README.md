# Machine Learning Blog: Resources and Code

Welcome to my Machine Learning blog! This repository contains resources and code for various machine learning topics, including tutorials, datasets, and code examples. The blog is designed to help learners understand machine learning concepts and their applications.

## Topics Covered:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for reducing high-dimensional data into lower dimensions.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Exploring methods where only a small portion of the data is labeled.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models for image classification tasks.
- **AI in Real-World Applications**: Examples such as encrypted traffic classification, diabetes detection using medical imaging, and more.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Code Examples**: All code is fully self-contained and can be executed directly.
- **Datasets**: Includes datasets like the Intel Image Classification dataset and MIT Indoor Scenes.
- **Project Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step explanations for machine learning projects, including model development, evaluation, and fine-tuning.
