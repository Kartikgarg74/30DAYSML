# Semi-Supervised Learning: Code Examples

This repository contains the practical implementation of **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** methods, including **Pseudo-Labeling**, as discussed in my blog. The code is fully self-contained and designed to help you understand how SSL can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance.

## Contents
- **Pseudo-Labeling Example**: A step-by-step implementation using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Simulated datasets for labeled and unlabeled data.
- Model training with labeled data, pseudo-label generation, and fine-tuning.
