# Time Series Analysis with Python  

This repository contains the code and resources accompanying my blog on **Time Series Analysis**. The blog provides a detailed introduction to time series concepts, including forecasting techniques like ARIMA and Prophet, and practical feature engineering for improved predictions.

## Blog Overview  

In the blog, we covered:  
1. **What is Time Series Analysis?**  
   - Understanding temporal data, trends, and seasonality.  

2. **Common Time Series Models**  
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).  
   - Prophet by Facebook for seasonal patterns.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Techniques like lag features, rolling statistics, and differencing.  

4. **Practical Implementation**  
   - Forecasting stock prices using ARIMA with Python.

## Repository Contents  

This repository includes:  
1. **time_series_analysis.py**:  
   - Self-contained Python script for forecasting stock prices using the ARIMA model.  
   - Generates predictions for the next 30 days and plots the results.  

2. **Sample Data Handling**:  
   - Code fetches real stock price data dynamically using `yfinance` (Google stock as an example).  
   - No need to upload external datasets.  

3. **Dependencies**:  
   - Required libraries include:  
     - `pandas`  
     - `matplotlib`  
     - `statsmodels`  
     - `yfinance`  

4. **Results Visualization**:  
   - The script outputs a clear comparison of historical stock prices and the forecasted trends.
