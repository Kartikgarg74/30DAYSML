# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Welcome to **Day 17** of our 30-Day Machine Learning series! In this repository, you will find all the resources, code snippets, and materials you need to understand and implement **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequence prediction and time-series forecasting tasks.

## ðŸ“‹ **Overview**
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequential data, where each output depends on the previous computations. In today's session, we cover:

1. **What is an RNN?**
   - The basic structure of RNNs and how they handle sequential data.
2. **How RNNs Work:**
   - The role of hidden states, backpropagation through time, and the vanishing gradient problem.
3. **Types of RNNs:**
   - Basic RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).
4. **Building an RNN Model:**
   - Step-by-step implementation of RNN models using TensorFlow/Keras.
5. **Applications:**
   - Time-series forecasting, language modeling, sequence-to-sequence tasks.
