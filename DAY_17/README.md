# Generative Models

Welcome to the **Day 17** repository of our 30-Day Machine Learning series! In this repository, you'll find all the resources, code snippets, and materials needed to understand and implement **Generative Models**, with a focus on **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.

## ðŸ“‹ **Overview**
Generative models are a class of machine learning models designed to generate new data samples from an underlying distribution. In this session, we dive into **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, a powerful type of generative model, and cover:

1. **What are Generative Models?**
   - Introduction to the concept and types of generative models.
2. **What are GANs?**
   - Structure and components of GANs: Generator and Discriminator.
3. **How GANs Work:**
   - The adversarial process: How the generator and discriminator work together.
4. **Building a GAN:**
   - Step-by-step implementation using TensorFlow/Keras.
5. **Training GANs:**
   - Common challenges and strategies for training GANs, including loss functions and optimization.
6. **Applications of GANs:**
   - Image generation, style transfer, and more.
